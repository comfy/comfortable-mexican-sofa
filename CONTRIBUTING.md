# Contributing
Contribute your code to ComfortableMexicanSofa in 5 easy steps:

### 1. Fork it

Fork the project. Optionally, create a branch you want to work on.

### 2. Get it running locally

- Install gem dependencies with `bundle install`
- There's nothing to configure, by default database is SQLite so it will be created for you
- Make sure that existing tests are passing by running `rake test:all`
- You should be able to start the app via `rails s` and navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin

### 3. Hack away

- Create a few small pull requests instead of a humongous one. I can merge small stuff faster.
- When adding new code just make sure it follows the same style as the existing code.
- Avoid adding 3rd-party dependencies if you can.
- Tests please, but nothing complicated. UnitTest / Fixtures all the way. Make sure all tests pass.

### 4. Make a pull request

If you never done it before read this: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

### 5. Done!

If everything is good your changes will be merged into master branch. Eventually a new version of gem will be cut.

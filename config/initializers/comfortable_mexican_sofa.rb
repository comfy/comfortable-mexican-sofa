  #   Heroku: $ heroku run rake comfortable_mexican_sofa:fixtures:import FROM=example.local TO=yourapp.herokuapp.com
  # From indicates folder the fixtures are in and to is the Site hostname you have defined in the database.

  # If you need to dump database contents into fixture files run:
  #   local: $ rake comfortable_mexican_sofa:fixtures:export FROM=localhost TO=example.local
  #   Heroku: $ heroku run rake comfortable_mexican_sofa:fixtures:export FROM=yourapp.herokuapp.com TO=example.local
  # This will create example.local folder and dump all content from example.com Site.
